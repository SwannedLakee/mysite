<p>
The Contura Aero is a very special laptop to me. It was the first computer I did not have to share. I was no longer afraid of deleting my father&rsquo;s work (or being blamed for it).
</p>

<p>
It was a gift from another person. It was a quite an expensive and luxurious computer for Chile in 1994 when I got it. My family would not have bought one just for me. I am grateful for it since it supported my interest for computers for many years.
</p>

<p>
For some years I became nostalgic about it and wanted to experience it again.
</p>

<h2 id="org853652f">The restoration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org853652f">
<p>
The Aero has a design problem in the display clutch (see <a href="https://www.rigacci.org/comp/aero/doc/aero_faq.html">2.1.5.7 Screen hinge problem (the darn &ldquo;clutch&rdquo;)</a> in the FAQ) which makes very hard to find one without a broken display bezel.
</p>

<p>
Over the span of a few years I bought two units on eBay. The first one had the broken bezel. I bought a second unit, without the cracks but it had a display that turned on and off intermittently. The plan was to make one out of two or three units.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, in addition to the FAQ, there are different &ldquo;cult&rdquo; sites like <a href="https://remember.the-aero.org/">https://remember.the-aero.org/</a> where one can find all kind of information.
</p>

<p>
Opening the device requires patience and being careful.

<p>
When I replaced the CMOS battery, the battery holder broke, and I had to unsolder the one from the other motherboard and pray it worked. It did.

<p>
Another question was whether to replace the hard disk. They are noisy, but the current one had a working Windows 95 install.
</p>

<p>
I thought about replacing it with a 32GB M.2 SATA SSD on top of a 2.5&ldquo; IDE adapter.
</p>

<p>
It did not boot.
</p>

<p>
I spent a lot of time here. I thought I could do all the installations on a VM putting the SSD on a M.2 SATA to USB adapter and have libvirt access the device directly.
</p>

<p>
I had not enabled LBA on the BIOS, which required an update first and then to select hard disk as &ldquo;Other&rdquo; type. Also I forgot the IDE adapter and the USB adapter could be exposing different geometries when I did the partition on the VM
</p>

<p>
After updating the BIOS, changing the hard disk type and using a BIOS overlay driver (Ontrack Disk Manager), <a href="https://www.philscomputerlab.com/ontrack-disk-manager.html">which nowadays you can get for free</a>, and installing DOS directly from floppies, I had a bootable machine with several logical drive letters (C:, D:, E:, F:&#x2026;) of 2G each.
</p>

<p>
Before closing it, I wanted to put as much software on the drive to play later, as I did not have another good way of moving data.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the partition type Ontrack Disk Manager creates is not a standard partition, but I could mount it by creating a loop device from the offset and then
</p>

<pre class="example">
losetup --partscan --find --show -o 32256 /dev/sdb
</pre>

<p>
And then you could see all FAT partitions using the loop device:
</p>

<pre class="example">
fdisk /dev/loop0 -l
</pre>

<pre class="example">
mount /dev/loop0p1 /mnt/c
</pre>

<p>
I put it different Windows I had on CDs, and a full copy of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/Simtel_CD-ROM_May_1995_General_Applications_Disc_1_1995">MS-DOS SIMTEL Collection</a>, which I owned and offered in my BBS around 1995.

<p>
When I was ready to close it and put back the screen bezel (the good one, the other was broken) I realized, the good one was missing a piece of plastic which allows the bezel screw to fixate against the display.
</p>

<p>
Instead of the screw cup, there was a hole:
</p>


<figure id="org07435cd">

</figure>

<p>
I had to fix this. Or choose to live with the broken Bezel which had a visible crack.
</p>

<p>
My wife suggested I 3D print it. I initially dismissed the idea because I don&rsquo;t have any 3D modeling skills, but it resulted much easier than I thought.
</p>

<p>
There is a <a href="https://openscad.org/">CAD program you can use with code</a>, which is quite simple for these geometrical stuff. Especially if you start with some AI prompt and iterate from there.
</p>

<p>
8 prototypes later and 2-3 min of print time each, I had the one I thought it would work.
</p>

<p>
Surprisingly, it worked perfectly, I did not even feel forcing the screw. And it closed.
